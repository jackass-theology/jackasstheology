<p>This is a weird post for me to write. Maybe I should first tell you that I graduated from John MacArthur&#8217;s seminary. You should probably know that I chose that seminary above all others because I was drawn to John MacArthur&#8217;s fearless preaching of the truth as God revealed it in Scripture. I value the education I received at the Master&#8217;s Seminary. </p>



<p>But—oh my gosh—I just heard an audio recording in which John MacArthur demeans and dismisses Beth Moore. I&#8217;m shaking. If I conjure up every ounce of optimism and benefit-of-the-doubt-ness I possess, I still can&#8217;t find a way to describe it as anything other than disdainful and mean-spirited. If I try to give an honest assessment of how it sounds to me, I think I have to say his words sound hateful and anti-Christ.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1068' height='601' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NeNKHqpBcgc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
</div></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s the scenario. John MacArthur is part of a panel discussion, and the moderator asks this: &#8220;I will say a word, and then you need to give a pithy response to that one word.&#8221; The word that MacArthur is asked to comment on? </p>



<p>Beth Moore.</p>



<p>MacArthur&#8217;s response is swift: &#8220;Go home.&#8221; </p>



<p>This was met by cheers and applause the audience. A roomful of people (attending the Truth Matters Conference which is celebrating 50 years of MacArthur&#8217;s ministry) cheered when a PASTOR dismissed a woman made in God&#8217;s image with a demeaning phrase. That word &#8220;pastor&#8221; means &#8220;shepherd.&#8221; This crowd joined a shepherd in collectively dunking on a woman who loves Jesus and loves Scripture and carefully does her best to promote Jesus wherever she goes.</p>



<p>This is absolutely disgusting. I&#8217;m seriously doing the theological equivalent of dry heaving right now. Once more I find myself pleading: <a href="https://jackasstheology.com/2019/05/12/stop-treating-beth-moore-like-garbage/">Stop treating Beth Moore like garbage!</a></p>



<p>MacArthur chose to elaborate a bit: &#8220;There is no case that can be made for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of discussion.&#8221; </p>



<p>Huge applause. </p>



<p>Except that there is a case that can be made for it, and this case is made by a huge number of scholars and followers of Jesus. MacArthur is allowed to disagree with Beth Moore. Holy smokes. Of course we can disagree about something like this! But he states with absolute confidence and condescension that no one can argue otherwise. And yet I&#8217;ll stand here as a graduate of his seminary, as someone who still employs the hermeneutical tools and methods I learned at his seminary, and make a strong argument to the contrary. So many do. It&#8217;s misleading, harmful, and disgusting to claim that one&#8217;s view on this—regarding which there are between one and a handful passages (depending on which passages one considers relevant) that say anything about this issue. </p>



<p>Phil Johnson, one of MacArthur&#8217;s right hand men, also on the panel, chose to answer the same prompt with the word, &#8220;Narcissistic.&#8221; He said, &#8220;When I first saw her I thought, &#8216;This is what it looks like to preach yourself rather than Christ.'&#8221;</p>



<p>I cannot tell you how disgusting it is to hear someone say this. It&#8217;s so unfair and cruel. It&#8217;s wild to publicly demean a preacher of the gospel who&#8217;s not even in the room. Again, this kind of dismissive attitude and contemptuous statement is anti-Christ. All of the <a href="https://jackasstheology.com/2019/08/23/the-heresy-of-unity/">many many many</a> calls for love, grace, unity, patience, gracious speech, humility, etc. are thrown out the window. All of the biblical warnings against causing division and controversy are ignored. </p>



<p>MacArthur went on, &#8220;Just because you have the skill to sell jewelry on the TV sales channel doesn&#8217;t mean you should be preaching. There are people who have certain hocking skills. Natural abilities to sell. They have energy and personality and all that. That doesn&#8217;t qualify you to preach.&#8221; </p>



<p>You can tell the  audience doesn&#8217;t know how to respond to that. </p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where I died. Those words are so condescending. They seem calculated to wound. To dishonor. To destroy. When I close my eyes and try to picture Jesus saying words like these, I gag. But these words would be right at home in the mouths of Pharisees. I feel qualified to make that last statement because I personally have Pharisaical tendencies. I&#8217;m constantly tempted to make myself the measure of orthodoxy and to define my preferred crowd as the &#8220;true people of God.&#8221; But I know I&#8217;m wrong in this. That&#8217;s why we started this blog. Jesus is too beautiful and his mission is too important for us <a href="https://jackasstheology.com/2019/01/02/what-is-jackass-theology%ef%bb%bf/">to be jackasses in the name of Jesus</a>.</p>

I&#8217;d like to believe so, and I&#8217;m honestly praying and checking my heart here. If there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m missing about this discussion, I&#8217;d love to hear it. But I believe John MacArthur and Phil Johnson need to repent for saying to the hand, &#8220;I have no need of you,&#8221; and to the foot &#8220;You&#8217;re narcissistic and should either stay at home or sell jewelry on TV.&#8221; I doubt they&#8217;ll read this, and I don&#8217;t expect to be heard favorably if they do, but this breaks my heart, and I&#8217;m confident it breaks the heart of Jesus, who gave his very life to serve and unify his church. </p>

                    <p>&#8220;Women are not called to preach.&#8221;<br />
Acts 18:26 &#8220;He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.&#8221;<br />
Acts 21:9 &#8220;He (Phillip) had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.&#8221;<br />
2 Timothy 4:24-26 &#8220;And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, 25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth.&#8221;<br />
Acts 10:42 &#8220;He commanded us (the crowd) to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.&#8221;<br />
Romans 16:7 &#8220;Greet Andronicus and Junia (a woman), my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.&#8221;<br />
Romans 16:2 &#8220;I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me.&#8221;<br />
The word for &#8220;benefactor&#8221; is &#8220;prostatis,&#8221; which means, &#8220;female guardian, protector, patroness.&#8221; The word denotes leadership and presiding over.</p>
<p>Paul, you are cherrypicking Scripture. There are many instances where women preach. I can think of more references in the Old Testament.<br />
&#8220;There is no defense for what beth Moore is doing.&#8221; I&#8217;m assuming you are referring to the act of preaching. But there is a defense. There are many scholars who believe that the Bible doesn&#8217;t restrict women from preaching. I suggest you do some more research, as you clearly have either not read all of the Bible or ignore parts of it to hold on to your &#8220;women can&#8217;t preach&#8221; doctrine.</p>

                    <p>I’m disgusted alongside you, Mark. It’s deeply disturbing. It makes me want to apologize to Beth personally, expecting that these two gentlemen will not. It reminds of a piece of advice a Jesus loving friend gave me years ago, “Allow the Jesus in you to forgive the Pharisee in them.” It’s helpful for me to remember I have been on both sides of this wounding.</p>

                    <p>Way to go Mark! This recording makes my skin crawl. Are women not allowed to teach other women?! What about Titus 2? It’s such an unloving and belittling tone they all had it makes me so sad. Are women now allowed to be apart of the body of Christ and use their gifts and talents? Was not a prostitute commended in the Hall of Faith in Hebrews?</p>

                    <p>Does John M believe that he is faithfully and literally applying &#8220;&#8230;treat them like an unbeliever&#8230;?&#8221; He is surely grasping at the treatment of false prophets of old, and carrying out his non-literal (ironic) application of &#8220;stoning the false teacher.&#8221; So he arrogantly judges our sister as either unbeliever or false teacher, when even Jesus declared he didn&#8217;t come to judge, but save. And Paul, who won&#8217;t even judge himself, much less the servant of another. And yes, rejoiced when the gospel was preached by no-matter-who. Better yet, has he exempted himself from the literal command to &#8220;&#8230;honor all people&#8230;?&#8221; I too am frightened by the outcomes, the influence, as evidenced in audience response. It is the followers of strong teachers who take even godly teaching to extremes. I shiver to think to what Pharisaical levels his followers will now freely and vigorously sink.  &#8220;Better,&#8221; Jesus said, &#8220;&#8230;a millstone be hung around his neck than that [John, who I am still holding out to be my brother, but barely,] cause any one of these little ones to stumble.&#8221; Yet thousands stumbled in our hearing. &#8220;But Lord, we preached in your name!&#8221; I can hear John crying out on that day. And my heart aches. And the Lord will say on that day, &#8220;I never knew you.&#8221; Who am I to do anything but tremble at the possibility that I may one day hear such words for my own unfaithfulness? But when the affront of pride slides so easily from his untamed tongue of fire, and then is shamelessly affirmed, and so heartily, by his stage-sharing-so-called-brothers, I am left to grieve, to weep, and to beg for this man&#8217;s soul.</p>

                    <p>I have never been comfortable with John MacArthur, but many people close to me are.  Many seem to take his word and his approach as the gospel truth, people I love who love Jesus.  My discomfort with his ministry has been an uninformed kind of gut reaction type of discomfort.  So, I’ve tried to have little to say about him, his church or his opinions.  That’s over.  I think that MacArthur and his followers believe in the sanctity of God’s word, and hold a high view of the standards set forth in scripture.  I truly believe that.  The problem is that they have their own interpretation, and seem to leave no room for those who, while seeking the Lord and listening to the prompting of the Holy Spirit, have landed elsewhere.  In villanizing alternate points of view, MacArthur has lost sight of one of the two greatest calls Jesus puts on our lives&#8230;love your neighbor.  Not love your neighbor when her theology lines up exactly with yours&#8230;..for goodness sake, Jesus metaphor in explaining this simple truth used a Samaritan.  </p>
<p>I have been wrestling with the teaching from 1 Timothy which seems to address women and their role in leadership.  To say there is can be no case that can be made for a woman preacher is ridiculous.  Setting up camps on alternate sides of incredibly nuanced issues wherein each side cannot hear (much less love) one another is foolish in any situation.  In the church it is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I’m having a hard time loving those I see as intolerant Pharisees right now.  The call on my life is to see them as deceived and not divide further.  Pray for me, I’m in a bad place on this one seeing villains and agents of evil.  Perhaps those I see as intolerant are the neighbors I must love well.</p>

                    <p>Mark, can you link or site your references for the scripture that refutes his claim that “There is no case that can be made for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of discussion.”?</p>
<p>Emotionally, I&#8217;m with you, that this is disgusting. I&#8217;d like to see a counter to his argument from scripture though.  You said twice that you (along with a &#8220;huge number of scholars and followers of Jesus&#8221;) can make that argument.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m with you on this.</p>

                    <p>Hey Dan! Yeah, thanks for asking. I’d cite verses like Gal. 3:28: “there is neither male nor female, all are one in Christ.” Or Rom. 16:2, where Paul honors Junia, a woman who seems to have been an apostle (though her name was changed in many Greek composite texts and English translations to a made up male form of the name around the time of the reformation). I’d also cite the same verses used to forbid women preaching, like 1 Tim 2:12, because it’s all about reading them in context. That same passage forbids braided hair or jewelry, but we all instinctively know Paul is not forbidding this for all women everywhere. He was dealing with a specific situation. It shouldn’t be considered invalid to see the same dynamics in play when Paul forbids women’s preaching a few verses later. Same with 1 Cor 11 and 14. Paul expresses says that women should prophecy (something MacArthur forbids), but Paul also appeals to the creation account to say that women must wear head coverings. Again, we all agree he’s addressing a specific situation (no one agrees on exactly what).</p>
<p>As for articles, here are a couple of short ones, though it’s hard to dig into the culture in such a short space. </p>
<p>Here’s one by NT Wright: <a href="http://www2.cbeinternational.org/CBE_InfoPack/pdf_files/wright_biblical_basis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www2.cbeinternational.org/CBE_InfoPack/pdf_files/wright_biblical_basis.pdf</a><br />
And one by Scot McKnight: <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/09/25/women-in-the-early-church/" rel="nofollow">https://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/09/25/women-in-the-early-church/</a></p>
<p>If you want a killer podcast that will challenge some of our prevalent assumptions about women in ministry, this one does a great job in giving an overview. Start with this episode and keep listening to the subsequent episodes in the series: <a href="https://overcast.fm/+NGLPe0VE8" rel="nofollow">https://overcast.fm/+NGLPe0VE8</a></p>
<p>If you want a good book on it, I’d recommend Alice Matthew’s “Gender Roles and the People of God,” Andrew Bartlett’s “Men and Women in Christ,” Lucy Peppiatt’s “Reduscovering Scripture’s Vision for Women,” or the “Two Views on Women in Ministry” book edited by Beck. If you want a short, sweet ebook on the Junia apostle thing, Scott McKnight’s “Junia Is Not Alone” is powerful. Another good short one is Michael Bird’s “Bourgeois Babes, Bossy Wives, and Bobby Haircuts.”</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. Plus, I’d love to sit down and chat about this if you want. As I said, I’m not trying to say complementarians are idiots, I think it’s a valid interpretation of some of those passages, I’m just saying that’s it’s dishonest of MacArthur to say you can’t make a case otherwise.</p>

                    <p>Mark what about 1 Tim 2:14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. This is why a woman is not supposed to preach. It isn&#8217;t about the times nor customs  as how long was creation from when Paul wrote this to Timothy?  Also Beth Moore aside from all this  is joining with Joyce Meyer? Have you seen her on the Joyce Meyer Show?  Joyce Meyer is proven heretic and Beth cant say enough good about her. Also Joel Olstine she is very close with and has gone to his church. Are we not supposed to call out false teachers, not join them?</p>

                    <p>Hi Troy!Thanks for the great questions.</p>
<p>With regards to 1 Tim. 2:14, it sounds to me like your reading is that Paul forbids women to preach because they are less intelligent than men. I don&#8217;t want to mischaracterize you, is that what you&#8217;re saying? I was taught that many years ago; it used to be a popular interpretation, but few scholars hold that view now. It is, no doubt, a complicated passage, but there are many ways to dig into Paul&#8217;s argument there and try to make sense of it. I&#8217;d recommend checking out some of the resources I&#8217;ve linked to in other comments if you want to see some of the possibilities. Just like you, I want to understand what the text actually means rather than choosing the interpretation that best fits my agenda, which is why I continue to study it. I used to be very convinced with exactly the logic you&#8217;re using: Paul ties it to creation, not culture, so he&#8217;s laying down a universal principle. That seems pretty airtight. But it&#8217;s actually not as open and shut as it sounds. Take 1 Corinthians 11, for example. Paul very clearly argues from the order of creation (he&#8217;s doing the exact same thing—tying his argument to the creation account) that women need to wear head coverings when they prophesy in church. I don&#8217;t know your context, but I&#8217;m guessing your church doesn&#8217;t make women wear head coverings (on the grounds that this was cultural) and that your church doesn&#8217;t allow women to prophesy in church (that&#8217;s an assumption based on your conservative stance, forgive me if I&#8217;m wrong in assuming that). So in 1 Cor. 11, most conservative scholars are willing to say, &#8220;yes, Paul ties his argument to creation, BUT head coverings is cultural so Paul&#8217;s argument IS NOT a universal principle,&#8221; and then when they get to 1 Tim 2, they say &#8220;Paul ties his argument to creation, SO forbidding women to teach IS a universal principle.&#8221; I&#8217;m not expecting to convince you here, but I hope you can see that it&#8217;s a little more complex than it might seem at first glance.</p>
<p>And with regard to Beth Moore being friendly with people you consider heretical, I&#8217;d encourage you to use a little more discernment. If it&#8217;s helpful, here&#8217;s something I wrote about similar accusations made against Francis Chan: <a href="http://jackasstheology.com/2019/03/15/farewell-francis-chan/" rel="nofollow">http://jackasstheology.com/2019/03/15/farewell-francis-chan/</a></p>

                    <p>Mark thank you for your reply.<br />
You as a Pastor, are leading the flock. You CAN NOT allow wolves among the sheep and say it is in love and you are loving the wolves!<br />
As a leader of the flock you cant afford it. You have given up your feelings  in exchange for the Word of God. You have to call out false teaching and warn the flock to do the same 2nd John. You don&#8217;t know anything about Todd White? Really? Man you better find out because he and a lot of others are preparing your flock for the slaughter.  Do you really not know we are in a war? We are soldiers man and this is a war! You better watch Frances Chan talking at IHOP and waiting for a word from God from Mike Bickle. Do you know who he is? You should look into it. Part of your job is to look into it!  The bible has hard lines. you don&#8217;t have to study Galatians 1:9 to know if someone brings another gospel they are accursed.  When Paul says he doesn&#8217;t allow a woman to preach because she was deceived that is exactly what he means. My wife is the one who made me look at this. Women are in NO way less than men as we are all equal, Peter says a weaker vessel 1Peter 3:7 .  They do have different roles  because of the fall,  period.   Different roles in this war. We have to have different roles Mark. We are not all called for the same work. Does the Word not tell us to separate from false teachers?  You don&#8217;t know who they are nor care because you don&#8217;t want to be unloving? Is that not love when Jesus warned the sinners as he hung out with them? Some of them heard and were saved, others left and were upset. The Truth is what is important. The Truth man! It hurts some times even smells like death to a lot of people , Corinthians. When the Truth smells like death you cant change the result of that.</p>

                    <p>Hey Troy,</p>
<p>Again, thanks for a gracious response. Man, I really resonate with what you&#8217;re saying. I have yet to have a congregant get into the teaching of Todd White or Mike Bickle, and I believe it would be irresponsible and fall into the category of &#8220;devoting myself to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith&#8221; if I were to spend all of my time researching various false teachers my flock might encounter at some point. I know a lot of pastors have devoted their ministries to this, but I need to stick to the Word of God and caring for the flock. </p>
<p>As a gentle pushback that I believe is in the spirit of the warnings you&#8217;re wisely giving here, are you sure your definition of &#8220;wolf&#8221; is correct? We tend to define &#8220;wolf&#8221; as &#8220;someone who teaches a different doctrine than the ones I consider to be most important,&#8221; but maybe that&#8217;s only a small part of it? Jesus warned us to look a tree and judge it by its fruit. To me, that seems to be a warning against people who&#8217;s lives, words, and ministries stir up division and slander and hatred rather than the fruit of the Spirit. Does that make sense? One way to stir up slander and hatred is to speak untruths about Jesus. I agree with that, and it sounds to me like that would be your primary definition. But another way is to quote verses from the Bible in ways that tear down people&#8217;s humanity and dignity and disregards that people are made in God&#8217;s image. I promise I&#8217;m not trying to get you to read everything we&#8217;ve written here, but here are a few places I&#8217;ve spelled out my thought process a bit more:</p>
<p>&#8211; This one called &#8220;Our Wicked Tendency to Use the Bible to Oppress,&#8221; which deals with our tendency to use God&#8217;s life-giving words of truth as a weapon: <a href="http://jackasstheology.com/2019/07/03/our-wicked-tendency-to-use-the-bible-to-oppress/" rel="nofollow">http://jackasstheology.com/2019/07/03/our-wicked-tendency-to-use-the-bible-to-oppress/</a><br />
&#8211; This one called &#8220;Stop Equating Peacemaking with Compromising,&#8221; where I think I&#8217;m addressing the very thing you&#8217;re worried about here: <a href="http://jackasstheology.com/2019/07/09/stop-equating-peacemaking-with-compromising/" rel="nofollow">http://jackasstheology.com/2019/07/09/stop-equating-peacemaking-with-compromising/</a><br />
&#8211; This one called there &#8220;Heresy of Unity,&#8221; where I insist that I&#8217;m taking the Bible seriously and literally when I choose to love a perceived enemy rather than bashing them: <a href="http://jackasstheology.com/2019/08/23/the-heresy-of-unity/" rel="nofollow">http://jackasstheology.com/2019/08/23/the-heresy-of-unity/</a><br />
&#8211; And then maybe this one called &#8220;Watchdog Theology,&#8221; where I try to explain why the &#8220;find everyone who disagrees and throw them out&#8221; approach is unbiblical: <a href="http://jackasstheology.com/2019/03/28/watchdog-theology/" rel="nofollow">http://jackasstheology.com/2019/03/28/watchdog-theology/</a></p>
<p>Truly, I&#8217;m thankful for your gracious engagement here. I believe we&#8217;re both seeking to do our best to be faithful to Jesus, His Word, and the calling He&#8217;s placed on our lives.</p>

                    <p>Thanks Mark for your quick reply. I appreciate your views and thoughts here. I am first hand seeing what loving without the salt of truth does to my kids, church friends and family. It is so easy to love and go along with things. I can be a great guy and a friend to everyone. It comes at a price, that price is truth. When you write an article defending Beth Moore and Francis Chan you have to dig a bit into the truth and what they are doing. Watch Beth Moore doting over Joyce Meyer on you tube. Watch Francis Chan doting over IHOP and MIke Bickle. After you see this you have to hang your head. You dont have to devote your ministry to this you do have to know the truth before you tell the world these guys are legit and are ok. Do you not?  What happened to not inviting these people into your home? Calling out the heresy? That is in the bible too man you have to take it all right? Thank you for your time with this. Division is not a bad thing if it is done by the Spirit and for Truth! You cant join with the dark.</p>

                    <p>HI Mark I am reading through some of your articles. You mention Rick Warren and not calling him a false teacher. Would not Galatians 1-9 and him partnering with the Catholic Church cause him to be accursed? As having a Catholic Priest speaking at his 2019 Saddleback Pastors convention? His Ecumenical ways would have to cause division. A Creekside Sheep commented on this article with a lot of eloquence and wisdom,  Would you consider Rick Warren table unity but not Sunday unity?  And if so your flock should be warned of him and the Catholic Church would you say?  I watched Rick Warren address a catholic audience and no gospel was shared. Just how much he loved them as brothers and sisters.</p>

                    <p>Troy,</p>
<p>The example of Rick Warren is really tough for me to get behind. I can understand choosing to disagree with or even argue against some of his specific decisions and positions, but to classify him as an enemy of the gospel has me scratching my head. To me, it seems like that would be saying, &#8220;to be considered a faithful Christian, you must agree with me about certain specifics regarding the catholic church, certain specifics regarding the ecumenical movement, etc.&#8221; The litmus test for who&#8217;s a faithful Christian becomes my own doctrinal convictions. To me, that seems to be going well beyond Scripture (1 Cor. 4:6).</p>

                    <p>Alongside Mark&#8217;s very helpful recommendations, let me add &#8220;Discovering Biblical Equality: Complimentarity Without Hierarchy,&#8221; which includes contributions from a couple dozen evangelical scholars.  Also along with the apostle Junia, take a closer look at the ministries of the prophet Huldah (2 Kings 23) and the deacon Phoebe (Romans 16).  For a deep dive into evangelical egalitarianism, I recommend the website for Christians for Biblical Equality and their scholarly journal The Priscilla Papers.</p>
<p>In my opinion, both complementarians and egalitarians are able to make a strong Scriptural case for their views. I think this issue is a difficult one and not something we should divide over. But regardless of one&#8217;s views on women in ministry, I think the way Johnny Mac spoke about Beth Moore was demeaning and appalling. It was especially perplexing to me in light of the fact that Beth Moore&#8217;s ministry has been almost exclusively to women and focused on helping them learn, memorize and apply the Word.</p>

                    <p>Oh this just too sweet. Has anyone asked how it is possible that inerrant scripture, THE one true word, can have such opposite interpretations. I mean really, IT almost seems as if the interpretations are really determined by what the world believes about gender roles at the time these interpretations are made. Complementarian/Egalitarian positions are really based on what is acceptable worldly standards at the time. </p>
<p>Early &#8220;Christians&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t even recognize you followers. Too funny.</p>

                    <p>After having recently come out of a decades long abusive, patriarchal marriage to a man who has the same opinions of women and their &#8216;place&#8217; in the church, I am certain this is grievous to Jesus. The mocking and laughing and dismissing of Beth, and all women, by Dr. MacArthur is disgusting and reprehensible, but not new. It is what I lived with for many years. This wrong theology was the bedrock of the toxic church I went to, taught from the pulpit and adhered to by so many (men) in the congregation. It&#8217;s been propagated for a very long time. There are countless wounded women who have left the church (more importantly their faith) because of this belief system. Shame on you, Dr. MacArthur. Thank you for writing about this. It&#8217;s about time. #endabusetowomeninthechurch</p>

                    <p>Julie, I too ended an abusive marriage just as you described, heavily influenced by the kind of thinking JM and company espouse. There is something so dehumanizing to be treated with contempt and derision, every single day, and have it dressed up like it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will. I am with you that this is grievous to Jesus.</p>
<p>The church has got to wake up to this. It&#8217;s starting. But there&#8217;s so much ground to cover. There&#8217;s a community of us women of faith dealing with devastation from abuse called Flying Free. If you haven&#8217;t heard of it, it may be a useful resource to you. Flyingfreenow.com .</p>

                    <p>Rachel, </p>
<p>Thank you for your kind words. I have been a member of Natalie&#8217;s group for over a year, which led me to other very helpful resources and support groups. </p>
<p>I have much to say on the subject of how women are treated in the church, but this is not the forum. I do see the church starting to heed the wake up call, but like you said, there is so much ground to cover. The John MacArthur video just reaffirms that change must start &#8216;at the top&#8217;. The hardest thing for me to wrap my brain around is how many women are leaving, not simply the church, but their faith. Countless women have walked away from God because they have been blamed, shamed, and abandoned by the church. </p>
<p>Grace and peace to you My Sister.</p>

                    <p>My heart hurts. I will pray for all involved- hurt and even mislead by his words. One must teach love and forgiveness as well as hell and brimstone. I simply love Beth Moore and its because of her teaching I became more faithful in my own walk.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for writing this. I&#8217;m absolutely heart-broken to learn of this behavior from a pastor, from all the men in the room that participated in the &#8220;joke&#8221;. The fact that the panelist selected her name as the first word for a response to isn&#8217;t lost in this either. Perhaps he knew it would get a reaction. So I&#8217;m asking myself&#8230;was this cruelty to Beth Moore simply for their own gain in laughs and applause? It&#8217;s despicable. I learned so many solid, biblical truths from the very meaty bible studies written by Beth Moore. Studies that didn&#8217;t come without a price to her while writing them. Her studies challenged the truths I held, that should have been challenged &#8211; and greatly deepened my relationship with Jesus.</p>

                    <p>I have lost a lot of respect for these men.  John MacArthur was right— he was set up.  I am not supportive of women preachers at all, but to slander her and accuse her on many levels is narcissistic and phariseical.  To hear people praising a preacher for a sermon public ally and saying “way to go” also seems very out of place.  Isn’t it God who deserves that glory.  The spirit and arrogance here is very uncomely for a child of God let alone a preacher of God’s Word.  It’s offensive!</p>

                    <p>Wait, you went to Master&#8217;s and MacArthur&#8217;s position on women in the pulpit shocks you? Also, context is key here. People are using an out of context quote from a Q&amp;A session to falsely claim that MacArthur and Johnson are somehow misogynistic. It&#8217;s ridiculous and baseless. Those men are simply upholding the biblical reality that qualified men are to be elders in the church. Go ahead, try to make the biblical case that women are to be elders in the church.  You won&#8217;t be able to from the scriptural text. Why doesn&#8217;t the Bible provide a list of qualification for women elders like it does for men?</p>

                <div class="comment-content">
                    <p>Hi Zach.</p>
<p>I did indeed go to Master&#8217;s, and no, Dr. MacArthur&#8217;s position on women in the pulpit does not shock me. I shared his view for many years. But we both know that wasn&#8217;t what my article was about. I said clearly that MacArthur is allowed to disagree with Beth Moore on this. That wasn&#8217;t may issue. I have two issues with what he said. The first is the mean way in which he said what he said. If you think I&#8217;m misreading this and MacArthur&#8217;s comment was meant to address something he disagreed with in such a way that his speech was full of grace and seasoned with salt and trying to uplift a woman that Jesus died to save and has been using powerfully for his kingdom, then please help me see what I&#8217;m missing. I&#8217;ve actually heard Dr. MacArthur lovingly and gently correct people many times. This was not that. I&#8217;m not positive, but I feel like Phil Johnson&#8217;s accusations might be more offensive to me—Dr. MacArthur could have corrected that but opted to give the jewelry hocking insult instead. I&#8217;m honestly confused that you say this is &#8220;ridiculous and baseless.&#8221; Zach, please feel free to defend complementarianism. I can make a strong case for this view as well. But are you actually wanting to defend the tone of these comments? In theory, we should be able to agree that neither of these men is perfect and that sometimes they&#8217;ll say and do things that dishonor God. This is frequently the case with me. Is this a time to double down on the supposed God-honoring nature of the kind of tone they used and the specific things they said? I also don&#8217;t agree that this is out of context. The clip shows their response to the question. MacArthur joked he was being set up. He knew it was a tricky situation. The moderator warned him to consider before he responded. And this is what he chose to say. For someone as comfortable speaking in front of large audiences (both in attendance and via audio—the event was celebrating 50 years of him preaching prolifically and speaking that preaching via radio), I believe he knows how to say things tactfully if he wants to.</p>
<p>And regarding your doubling down on MacArthur&#8217;s statement that you can&#8217;t make a case from the scriptural text, I&#8217;m struggling not to see your statement as disingenuous. Zach, have you read any of the many books and articles from Bible-believing egalitarians? Do you know any egalitarians and have you listened to any of their arguments? Because the thing is they DO make a biblical case and they DO make that case from the scriptural text. I&#8217;m pretty sure what you&#8217;re meaning to say is, &#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to make a Scriptural case that I will see as valid.&#8221; And that&#8217;s fair. But it&#8217;s wrong to say that it can&#8217;t be made. That&#8217;s my second issue with MacArthur&#8217;s answer. </p>
<p>As for your last comment, I don&#8217;t believe 1 Timothy 3 is meant to be a list of qualifications for male elders. It&#8217;s just talking about the qualifications for an elder. Period. It uses the phrase &#8220;husband of one wife,&#8221; and there are disagreements here, but I don&#8217;t believe Paul is trying to speak exclusively of men any more than he is trying to refer to only men when he frequently uses the term &#8220;brothers.&#8221; It&#8217;s poor exegesis to stop at how a phrase sounds to us in English. There are great books you an read on this that dig into the biblical context, language, culture, and flow of argument. But even on a very surface level, Paul also says in following verses that deacons must be &#8220;the husband of one wife,&#8221; and yet we have examples of female deacons (Rom. 16:2). I&#8217;m not saying you have to agree with me, I&#8217;m simply saying that it&#8217;s wrong and unhelpful of Dr. MacArthur to pretend that no one can read the Scripture and come to a different conclusion than he does.</p>

                    <p>Yes, in context the tone and the content were just fine. Beth Moore is a very public figure. She&#8217;s not just some woman who happens to have questionable theology in this area. She is a very popular leader with a strong following and a large platform. Given her position and her recent willingness to embrace the social justice/critical theory movement, criticism is not only appropriate, but biblically demanded. Critical theory is unbiblical and divisive at its core. It offers no hope of reconciliation or redemption. It has nothing to do with the Gospel of Christ but finds it origins in secular humanism. It has also been shown that Moore has selectively edited some her previous work to remove references to a biblical stance on the issue of homosexuality. She is clearly heading in a dangerous direction.  And she isn’t alone. Other significant contingents within the Southern Baptist Convention have embraced critical theory and &#8220;wokeness&#8221;, including Moore&#8217;s good friend and current SBC president, J.D. Greear. It has also become increasingly popular in these same circles to question biblical complementarity and the very clear biblical teaching of the exclusivity of men in pastoral leadership (It would not be surprising at this point to see Moore become the next president of the SBC).  However, the popular arguments in favor of placing women in pastoral roles are not coming from a careful and consistent examination of the scriptural texts. Instead, there are appeals to all kinds of extra biblical sources, popular social sentiment, feminism, and a myriad of teachers who eisegetically read their own man-centered notions of gender roles into the biblical texts. Understanding that this Q&amp;A session took place at a conference addressing the subject of Biblical Sufficiency, the strong denunciation of someone who has a pattern of undermining that sufficiency, is completely appropriate, whether it is a man or woman.</p>
<p>On a related note, I want to ask you, is Scripture really sufficient for faith and practice? You stated that you’ve changed your understanding regarding what the Bible says about men and women in pastoral leadership? But what was the catalyst? Did that change of mind come primarily from a careful study of the scriptures themselves, or was it perhaps influenced more strongly by current cultural and social sentiments/conventions? Again, there isn&#8217;t any place in the scripture from which the positive case for women as pastors/elders can be made. We shouldn&#8217;t build doctrine on arguments from silence. And you assert that when Paul talk about the qualification for elders he&#8217;s being ambiguous about gender, is contextually absurd. It&#8217;s obvious that he should be the &#8220;husband of one wife&#8221; clearly assumes Paul is talking about men in that context. </p>
<p>To the issue of who is or who isn&#8217;t being disingenuous – taking an objective view of the video clip in question, especially considering the subject matter of the conference, the format, the men involved, and your own personal insight – I still find it hard to believe that your “disgust” wasn’t driven more by how you feel the out-of-context quote hit the ears of the uninformed masses, than what was actually expressed by those men.</p>

                    <p>Hi Zach,</p>
<p>Yes, I believe in the sufficiency of Scripture. I read constantly, so after reading more and more research on the passages in question, I eventually reached a tipping point. If you&#8217;d like to be introduced to some egalitarian scholars who believe in inerrancy and sufficiency and are doing exegetical work on this issues (sounds like you haven&#8217;t been pointed to any resources like this yet), I&#8217;d encourage you to read: Alice Matthew’s “Gender Roles and the People of God,” Andrew Bartlett’s “Men and Women in Christ,” Lucy Peppiatt’s “Reduscovering Scripture’s Vision for Women,” or the “Two Views on Women in Ministry” book edited by Beck. If you want a short, sweet ebook on the Junia apostle thing, Scott McKnight’s “Junia Is Not Alone” is powerful. Another good short one is Michael Bird’s “Bourgeois Babes, Bossy Wives, and Bobby Haircuts.”</p>

                    <p>Marc, your patient and thought provoking responses to Zach are further evidence of your desire to shine the light on Jesus in everything you write and say.  I cannot grasp the determination of men like Zach to proclaim there is only one way to interpret scripture regarding women in leadership positions in the church.  I read fear in his position; fear and a desperate sense that Jesus will not prevail unless men take the hard and immovable stance regarding his own view of scripture.  I have a strong orthodoxy myself, formed over 60 years of studying the Bible commentary by Matthew Henry, the devotions of Oswald Chambers, the apologetics of C.S. Lewis, and the life of Corrie ten Boom, a family friend.  I have close friends and family influenced by the same who come to different conclusions than I do.  How we respond to those who have differing views is absolutely vital.  Like you, I am constantly seeking to gut-check myself&#8230;are my motives pure?  Am I speaking with grace and mercy?  Do I desire to promote myself or am I building up the Body?  When I listen, am I really seeking to hear and understand, or simply preparing my own rebuttal?  These are things to consider in conversation with God before speaking or writing and I hope this will co to use throughout the rest of my life.  As I re-read your article and responses to comments, I continue to believe that God is using you to speak truth in love.  Again, I thank you.</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;m not asking for a list of books. Since you brought it up let&#8217;s try an example. Please demonstrate to me how this passage &#8211;<br />
 &#8220;Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full[a] respect.  (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.&#8221;  &#8211; is addressing anything other than the qualifications for men as elders in the church.<br />
You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s had the change of mind. You claim the Bible allows for it. How can someone who has studied the Greek (presumably, based on your attending Mater&#8217;s) and knows how the language works, honestly argue that this passage is in any way ambiguous regarding gender?<br />
It&#8217;s very popular today to assert all kinds of things regarding what the Bible has to say on a whole host of issues, especially when historical and orthodox beliefs come into direct conflict with popular conventions and ever changing social mores. It&#8217;s much less popular (and far less common) for people to even make an attempt to backup their assertions using the source text, let alone to do without violating the principles of hermenuetical consistency or the basic rules which govern honest textual criticism.</p>

Zach, he literally already answered this. He said that the Greek doesn&#8217;t say the same thing as the English translation does. Many scholars who know Greek have stated that this passage in the Greek doesn&#8217;t in and of itself restrict women from being elders (based on Greek grammar and pronouns). Even many complementarian scholars have agreed.<br />
It seems this pastor doesn&#8217;t desire to offer an extended response, probably because he doesn&#8217;t want to get into a heated debate, which I think is a wise choice. So he&#8217;s offered you some books to do some more research on the topic. If you are truly looking for truth, you would be open to doing more research. There are many articles online that are not 100-200 page books, but rather 5-page articles.</p>

                    <p>Wrong. Neither the Greek or the surrounding literary context for any of the passages in question allow for the ambiguity one would need to argue against the long held biblically orthodox position that men, and men alone, are to be elders in the church. Those who are trying to convince people otherwise, are dependent on arguments outside the text, they are not deriving their opinions from a careful exegesis of the source material.</p>

                    <p>Hey Zach,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we need to keep this going. You keep insisting that you&#8217;re not interested in considering any viewpoints but your own. That&#8217;s honestly fine with me, you&#8217;re absolutely entitled to your interpretation and I applaud you for your firm convictions. But it&#8217;s probably time to stop being surprised that there are still people in these comments who are wanting to consider views other than your own. </p>
<p>I will just point out that this comment you made here is demonstrably wrong. Again, you&#8217;re entitled to your interpretation, but it&#8217;s patently false that &#8220;neither the Greek or the surrounding literary context for any of the passages in question allow for&#8230;&#8221; a non-complementarian view. It&#8217;s also completely false that &#8220;those who are trying to convince people otherwise, are dependent on arguments outside the text, they are not deriving their opinions from a careful exegesis of the source material.&#8221; Feel free to not take my offer here, but if you&#8217;d like to look into the Greek of the passages in question and/or find egalitarians grounding their arguments in careful exegesis of the relevant texts, then I encourage you to pick up a copy of &#8220;Two Views on Women in Ministry,&#8221; edited by Craig Blomberg. It presents the exegetical arguments of two complementarians and two egalitarians. What&#8217;s striking is that the world-class complementarian scholars who contributed to this volume treat their egalitarian &#8220;opponents&#8221; with grace and give dignity to their arguments and exegetical work. They disagree, but they&#8217;re not dismissive or argumentative. </p>
<p>And this takes me back again to my discouragement with our interactions here. I continue to assert that I am not protesting MacArthur&#8217;s complementarian views, but rather his demeaning speech. I continue to ask you whether you approve of his tone and choice of words, but you continue to pretend that my problem is with complentarianism. It&#8217;s fine if you don&#8217;t want to engage on that topic, but that&#8217;s what my post has been about. </p>
<p>I only want to uphold the truth of Ephesians 4:31–32 &#8220;Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>&#8220;Critical theory is unbiblical and divisive at its core. It offers no hope of reconciliation or redemption. It has nothing to do with the Gospel of Christ but finds it origins in secular humanism. It has also been shown that Moore has selectively edited some her previous work to remove references to a biblical stance on the issue of homosexuality. She is clearly heading in a dangerous direction. And she isn’t alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>^ That&#8217;s a criticism.</p>
<p>What McArthur did was to mock and demean. Surely you can see the difference. In your comment, you&#8217;re discussing what you understand Moore to  believe based on what you&#8217;ve heard and read, and what you believe she has objectively done. MacArthur and the other DudeBros were enaging in an Ad Hominem attack.</p>

                    <p>Wrong. It&#8217;s a cop-out. Rather than demonstrate a pro-biblical argument (he should be capable given his training and office) he deflects and appeals to extra-biblical academic sources. If it is so obvious that the bible promotes women as pastors and preachers Pastor Mark should be able to succinctly and clearly present his case from the scriptural text.</p>

                    <p>This situation has to be looked at in context.  John MacArthur was on a stage in his own church at his own conference.  The room was filled with like minded people who know very well where he stands on the issue of women in the pulpit.  When the moderator said “Beth Moore” the laughs from the crowd were not mocking or rude.  It was more like “oh no, we know how Pastor John feels about this topic”.  And when he said “period. End of paragraph.” that was to be expected.  Again, everyone in that room knows that Dr. MacArthur has his doctrinal view locked in on this issue.  He is a Biblical scholar and has been a pastor for five decades.  I think he has preached a few sermons on this and didn’t need to preach another in this forum.  His comment about selling jewelry on TV&#8230;..I did not interpret that at all as a personal attack on Beth.  He was making the bigger point that all of your gifts must be filtered through God’s framework/His word.  So just because Beth is gifted with many of the talents necessary to preach, that does not mean it is permissible in God’s perfect design.  If my daughter has a beautiful body, she may be able to make a lot of money modeling skimpy swimsuits, but that doesn’t line up with scripture, therefor I wouldn’t encourage it.  I saw that as his overriding point.  MacArthur went on to say that he is bothered by the culture creeping into the Bible, and he sees feminism creeping in here.  Everyone should listen to the whole clip, and remember that he was among “family” during this discussion.  Theologically, I believe he is right on.  And his willingness to stand firm in the truth is refreshing.  This country is on a dangerous, slippery slope falling farther and farther away from God.  Nobody knows God anymore because His word is being compromised, watered down, and reshaped to our liking.  Praise God for men like John MacArthur who unapologetically preach the Truth!</p>

                    <p>Hi Courtney! </p>
<p>Thanks for commenting. What I have always loved about Dr. MacArthur is that he is willing to speak the truth even when it&#8217;s not popular. But that wasn&#8217;t my concern with his statements. I appreciate your attention to the context of the event. For me personally, I&#8217;m having a hard time coming up with any context in which this would be God-honoring speech. Again, it&#8217;s not his position, it&#8217;s the way he chose to—I think—attack someone else. I can understand what you&#8217;re saying about him being in his own church at his own conference and therefore feeling comfortable. But of course, that doesn&#8217;t make it okay. I can be in my own literal home all by myself and feeling very comfortable and still sin. It&#8217;s also interesting that the conference was celebrating 50 years of his prolific preaching ministry and of his sermons, conferences, and Q&#038;As being distributed worldwide over the airwaves. I just don&#8217;t buy that he didn&#8217;t understand that other people would be hearing what he said. </p>
<p>We can disagree of course, and I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re looking for the best in this. One thing that would actually help me a lot is if Dr. MacArthur issued a statement clarifying what he meant or stating that he was being misunderstood. I&#8217;m sure people around him have heard of the controversy his statements have caused, and if it were me, I&#8217;d be eager to explain that I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt a beloved image bearer of God and faithful co-laborer for the gospel. I&#8217;d issue an immediate apology and explain unequivocally that I respect Beth Moore as someone who loves Jesus and has devoted her life to serving him, but that I still disagree with her convictions in this area. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do. I&#8217;d love to see him clarify along those lines.</p>

                    <p>I’m glad to see a few people coming forward in support of the Complementarian point of view, and even in support of John MacArthur.  One of the great things about this forum is that it has generally been a safe place for people to disagree.  I will continue to strive to do my best to understand and empathize with folks here who disagree with me.  I do empathize with MacArthur’s high view of scripture.  I take incredible exception with what/‘how he expressed his point of view.  I listened to the entire audio, and I can say with certainty that my disgust with the approach to Beth more does not come from a place of taking a few comments out of context.</p>
<p>Courtney, I think you are right.  Our country is on a dangerous course of falling further and further away from God.  I’m becoming increasingly convinced that is happening because Christians don’t lead with love.  The men on that stage are so convinced that they are right, that they leave no room for another interpretation.  They seem more concerned with being right than they are with loving others well in the name of God.  Jesus said Love God and love your neighbor.  He didn’t say love God, understand the desire and will of our incomprehensible God fully and allow for no quarter for those who disagree with you, and then love others.  </p>
<p>The lack of charity shown to Beth Moore here makes my skin crawl.  When MacArthur’s colleague Phil said Beth Moore is preaching herself rather than Christ when she says she tries to put herself in the narrative is twisting Beth Moore’s words.  Talk about taking something out of context!  Aren’t we all called to find the truth God is teaching us personally as we study God’s Word?  No one came to her defense.  If I was in the crowd when MacArthur told Beth Moore to go home, I would have booed.  When she was compared to a huckster jewelery salesperson I would have booed.  </p>
<p>I got particularly discouraged when MacArthur took a stand against feminism.  I don’t see anything wrong with a woman as a Senator, Congressman or President.  No one maligns men for being power hungry when they aspire to such a role, rather we look at their character and form opinions accordingly.  </p>
<p>What this forum is trying to point out is that as Christians we are to be known for our love, but instead we are known for what we stand against.  We love you as long as you aren’t Democrat, Feminist, LGBTQ, Socialist, Pro-Abortion, any denomination but mine&#8230;.shall I go on?  Seriously, if all we love are people like us who agree with us than who will love the lost?!?</p>
<p>Courtney, I agree with you.  Our country is moving away from God.  I’m afraid it is because we have lost our calling and not because of our lack of regard for the truth of scripture.  Our calling is to seek the lost, not reject others who don’t agree with us.</p>
<p>John MacArthur said there is no room for an alternate view of women’s role in the church&#8230;.period, end of sentence.  I disagree.  I’ll leave you with these two questions which gave me the room I needed to begin investigating the complementarian point of view:<br />
Our God is unchanging and only good.  I’m sure we all agree.  Why would our unchanging God use women in leadership (Miriam, Deborah etc.)  and then decide it’s a bad idea?  If Paul was forbidding women as leaders for all places and all times, why would he work so closely alongside women leaders (Priscilla, Junia)?</p>

                    <p>We are falling away because love has grown cold. Thank you for posting this. It was a sad and grievous ugly tho g forJohn Mac to say so publicly. But. It sure brought about what is in the depths of Beth Moore’s heart; gracious kind words, inclusive words in response, not reaction, to such a arrogant self righteous public scorning.</p>

                    <p>One more thing about the reaction to all this &#8211; the term repentance is being tossed around quite a bit here &#8211; but what sin are MacArthur and Johnson guilty of? As I recall, Jesus, Paul, and the other writers of the NT all used strong language when addressing unbiblical or heretical teaching. Should they have repented? Additionally, Beth Moore is a public teacher with a large following, she is not a member of MacArthur&#8217;s flock. Given her notoriety, position and responsibilities, his response in addressing her error should look different than if he were addressing a member of his flock who was in error. Again, there is biblical precedent for this.</p>

                    <p>By referencing a verse that is 100% referring to false teachers, it can be implied that you were calling him one.  Please choose another verse to call out his sin. Being a pastor, surely you know that reading/quoting the Bible out of context leads to much heresy.  And remember Ecclesiastes 7:20&#8230;&#8221;Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.&#8221;  John MacArthur sinned.  Period.  End of paragraph.  Instead of giving him a call or an edifying email, all of the Monday morning quarterback &#8220;christian&#8221; bloggers decided to put up flashy graphics and use words like &#8220;disgusting&#8221; to encourage us all to be better.  John MacArthur was crucified in the public square for &#8220;uncharitable speech&#8221;.  Elders are worthy of double honor, however, he was given a good spanking and zero grace.  You all splattered his misstep worldwide over the internet&#8230;.causing division among believers and doubt among unbelievers.  If there is any repentance to be happening here, you may want to look in the mirror.</p>

                    <p>Courtney,  I see this differently.  However, I do agree with you on your greater points&#8230;.we need to lead with grace, we need to promote unity in the church, and we need to find ways to love people well even when we disagree with what they have done.   This is as true for John MacArthur as it is for Beth Moore.</p>
<p>That said, MacArthur is a leader in his church, speaking in a public forum, and the interview was posted as a proclamation for all to hear.  Also, MacArthur is presenting his position as irrefutable, and as obviously God’s perspective on the matter.  If the comments were made to me in private, I would object in private.  I believe he sullied the Gospel for all to see, and so I must also speak for all to see.  I have not spent my life building the kind of platform that MacArthur has, and my voice will be heard by few.  His has been heard by millions.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that you recognized his behavior as sin, and that’s the issue I see.  I don’t agree with his “I’m right and you all must agree or be labeled heretic” stance, but I know he didn’t come to his position lightly. That is not the issue.  I believe that if we allow poor treatment of women by the church and church leaders to be seen as acceptable, we will lose our chance to preach the Gospel to many who need it.  </p>
<p>I know you don’t appreciate the verses Mark cited in his critique of the interview.  I hold that the Bible is replete with admonitions against the behavior that has sparked the controversy.  Mark already cited Colossians 4:6 “Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.”</p>

                    <p>Sean &amp; Dave, hopefully this will be my last response and then y’all can be rid of me.  I’m not going to further address John MacArthur’s sin.  We can all agree that his verbiage of “go home” could have been a little more grace-filled.  And I am also not going to address Phil Johnson’s comments, which I actually find to be much more hurtful than JM’s.  But nobody really knows who Phil is, so his name wasn’t sensational enough to make the headlines.  I have three general areas of concern/disagreement with what you’ve said.</p>
<p>1.  John MacArthur is absolutely allowed to have a FIRM opinion on this doctrinal topic.  In firm, I mean, he can believe that he is right and that there is no other way.  That is why we have so many denominations and churches within the Christian faith……because Bible reading, Bible teaching leaders have interpreted the Bible differently.  Sean, you don’t seem to like that MacArthur sees his “position as irrefutable” and that he has the “I’m right and you all must agree or be labeled as a heretic”.  Well, newsflash, every Pastor holds their positions with great conviction, and if they don’t, they are weak Pastors and I grieve for their confused flock.  How are they to teach if they don’t hold a solid position?  The issue of female leadership/teaching in the church is what I consider an “open-handed” doctrine.  It is not essential for salvation.  I believe that there will be people from both sides of the fence in heaven.  However, there is ONE interpretation that is correct, and that is God’s.  God DOES have an opinion on this topic.  We will know the correct interpretation in heaven.  I tend to think John MacArthur is correct, however, who knows, maybe I’ll be surprised.  Maybe Beth Moore is correct.  I can’t wait to find out!  But we won’t know this side of heaven.  In the meantime, John MacArthur has every right to teach his view, and only his view, to his congregation, or to any who make the choice to listen to him.  We are called to be watchmen on the wall, sounding the trumpet when we see danger approaching.  In that panel discussion, MacArthur was sounding a trumpet regarding a doctrine he sees as dangerous.  That does not make him unloving or harsh.  Maybe his choice of words could have been better, but the fact that he regards his position as correct, is absolutely acceptable, and in fact expected in his position of leadership.  </p>
<p>2.  The public nature of the rebuke that John MacArthur received on this website, and hundreds of others, by brothers in Christ, was completely unbiblical, sad, and honestly shocking in my opinion.  Now unbelievers ranting about it, I don’t care….they don’t know better.  But you guys…..mature believers?  The Bible speaks of discipline in Matt. 18 and in summary, in order for it to happen a person must be a believer, affiliated with the church that is disciplining them, and must be knowingly and defiantly persisting in sin.  There is absolutely NO biblical case for Pastors or laypeople outside of one’s local, covenant membership to discipline another believer.  And that is exactly what has been done to JM.  He has been “disciplined”…which means, by definition, rebuked for an offense.  You may say, “oh we were just encouraging other believers to do better, using this already public situation as an example”.  Nope, no biblical case for that.  Proverbs 17:19 &#8211; “Whoever covers an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates friends”.  You defamed the name of an anointed man of God and spread his sin further and wider than it would have ever gone.  I know the internet “feels” like our church sometimes with all of the dialogue that happens here, but it is not!  Neither Dave, Max Lucado, J.D. Greear, or anyone else has the authority to publicly rebuke John MacArthur.  There are a million other ways to encourage your flocks to love better.  Holding up a brother’s sin and calling it “disgusting” and “appalling” is actually the MOST appalling thing I can think of.  What took place on these blogs was gossip, slander, and unwholesome talk, all in the name of “love”.  We need to be VERY careful about broadcasting a fellow believer’s sin publicly.  It is not a loving or biblical response to sin, and therefore does harm on so many levels.  There is no example of this behavior anywhere in the Bible.  And please don’t use Paul and Peter…..they were within each other’s direct church community, therefore, it was entirely permissible what Paul did.  It seems almost commonplace to blog about a topic like this because JM is a public figure and christian bloggers and commentators these days can’t miss an opportunity to strike while the iron is hot.  But be careful….never at the expense of a brother in Christ.  On the other hand, it is 100% appropriate for the elders of Grace Community to pull John aside and draw to his attention anything that is deemed as sinful.  That may have happened, but honestly, it is not our business.  Sean, you justified the public nature of this incident by saying that these comments were “posted as a proclamation for all to hear”.  That is unequivocally false.  The comments did become public, but they were not posted by Dr. MacArthur or his staff.  If you can find otherwise, then I apologize for my error.  The session has never been posted on the app, the website, or anything published by the church.  The video is nowhere to be found.  It looks like an “audio leak”.  Many other sermons from the conference were posted, but this never was.  And it wasn’t posted and removed in response to the controversy.  It was NEVER posted.  I am under the impression that it was always meant to be a session to remain within those walls.  Kind of a “family” discussion on doctrine.  Again, not making the case at all that sin is okay if it is in secret.  I’m simply refuting your comment that John MacArthur made himself public, therefore that justifies public scrutiny.  You said that he “sullied the gospel for all to see, and so I must speak for all to see”.  Um, no, John MacArthur’s sin is not your responsibility.  If you are an elder at GCC, then yes, but you are not, so not in your job description. </p>
<p>3.  Sean, lastly, in one of your earliest comments you said that people are leaving the church because Christians don’t lead with love.  You say we are “more concerned with being right than loving others”.  Don’t really know where to start here.  What city do you live in?  I live in Dallas.  We just got hit with a tornado a few days ago.  Schools, homes, and business were destroyed in the heart of our city.  While everyone is pitching in to help, who are the most visible in the recovery effort?  Christians.  Where are all of the drop off locations for supplies and food?  Churches.  When I went to clean up, who was I with?  Mainly believers in Jesus.  Who runs the abortion clinics trying to save the lives of innocent children?  Christians.  Where were your children born?  Very likely it was a Baptist, Presbyterian, or Methodist hospital.  When you serve in a soup kitchen on Thanksgiving day, who are you most likely serving with?  Christians.  When you go in a prison on a Saturday, who is usually there crying with and loving on the people?  Christians.  Since when have we gotten the bad wrap o not leading with love?  I’ll tell you where….from our “progressive” and tolerant culture that is speaking lies to us and telling us that proclaiming the truth and holding an opinion on something is “unloving”.  Suddenly, sharing with people that homosexuality is not God’s design for relationships is harsh and unloving.  Actually, it is the most loving thing you can tell someone struggling in that sin.  Let me tell you, my hairdresser for TEN years was a gay man.  I sat in his chair 6 times a year for 10 years.  My hair takes a long time to color, so doing the math, I spent upwards of 180 solid hours with this man.  I laughed with him, cried with him, knew his mom and his aunts’ names, tipped him well, bought him gifts (including a Bible and his favorite brand of shirt at Nordstrom…lol), and cried when we hugged goodbye before he moved to a different city to be closer to family.  He KNEW that I loved him.  But, I never ONCE endorsed his lifestyle.  That would have been the most cruel thing I could have ever done.  I always spoke truth to him.  He was a lost, unhappy soul, hidden behind a bright smile and outgoing personality.  He was walking outside of God’s will and I was NOT going to tell him that it was okay.  I LOVED him by telling him that God loves him and has a BETTER way for him.  God’s truth is NEVER unloving.  The problem with Christianity is that we don’t have truth anymore.  Everything is permissible now.  That’s why we don’t look different from the world.  Why would people be attracted to Jesus?  We’ve made him look like some worldly dude who just thinks all is okay if we love people.  Well love doesn’t exist without truth.  Love rejoices with the TRUTH.  Jesus is the way, the TRUTH, and the life.  You will know the TRUTH, and the TRUTH will set you free.  Need I go on?  Biblical truth is imperative.  Hence the name of John MacArthur’s conference….”Truth Matters”.  But it has been lost.  Because pastors are so fearful of being scrutinized and judged, just as JM has been judged this week.  Thankfully, we still have pastors like Dr. MacArthur who care more about God’s glory than public opinion.  Absolute truth is a very unpopular concept these days.  One of the most absolute truths in the history of the world, one’s gender, is now not so absolute.  So, we are not missing LOVE, we are missing TRUTH.  The prevailing cultural virtue of tolerance has infiltrated the evangelical church.  And  one last thing…..in response to your quote “if the poor treatment of women is seen as acceptable, we lose our chance to preach the gospel”.  By this statement you are making a HUGE and accusatory statement about John MacArthur. You are insinuating that he treats women poorly.  Really?  Because of his “go home” statement?  Why don’t you speak to his wife, daughters, sisters, friends, and women in his congregation before you toss an awful statement like that out there in the open?  Shameful.  I can assure you that John MacArthur does not treat women poorly.     </p>
<p>If we are to love, shouldn’t we LOVE our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ the BEST?  If I can’t love, forgive, and encourage my own family, how can I possibly love strangers?  Wouldn’t a more appropriate headline to this situation have been….”All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, BUT Jesus’ blood covers all, and we love and forgive our faithful brother in Christ even in his missteps…..just as we will love you even in your missteps.  Come to our imperfect church and meet Jesus, the Forgiver of all sins”.  That wold have reflected this LOVE that you speak of.  But, unfortunately, Pastors went a different and sinful direction.  And it didn’t help anyone.</p>

                    <p>Courtney, thank you for all of your thoughtful responses.  It’s obvious that you hold a deep, abiding love of Jesus, and I’m confident that if we knew each other personally we would find much more unites us than divides us.  I admire your stand for righteousness, and your defense of your brother in Christ.  This will be my last comment on the matter too.</p>
<p>Like you, I have served shoulder to shoulder with Christians who serve the lost, the lowly, the forgotten, and the hurting in the name of Jesus.  It’s during these times that I see the Church (the big “C” church meaning the family of God) working together as it should.  Like you I hold there are some absolute truths.  Like you I see issues we grapple with as open handed and closed handed.  My thinking was changed very radically when talking to a colleague from work about my faith.  She, like you, has a dear friend who is gay.  Her friend’s experience wasn’t like that of your hairdresser.  Rather, he was shouted down they day before by Christians while he was at a rally in support of same sex marriage.  My colleague’s first question to me upon opening what might have been an illuminating conversation about faith was targeted at how Christian’s stand opposed to same sex marriage.  I’m not trying to open a discussion about that issue, but I did realize in that moment that all she knew about Christians was what they stand against.  Since then, much like you I suspect, I make sure I have earned the respect of someone before I discuss what the Bible has to say about their sin.  I see the disintegration of the church into denomination after denomination as another symptom of the church continuing to take stands on what it is against.  Certainly there are justified splits, but so many are over what I think we would both see as open handed issues.  I think it breaks God’s heart to see His children squabbling so.  I belong to an Evangelical Free church, and I think MacArthur’s church does as well&#8230;.maybe not.  I do, however, see us all as part of the same family, and it hurts me when my brothers and sisters go to war over these open handed issues.  Yes, we owe a great debt of grace to our brothers and sisters in Christ.  Perhaps you are right and I should give MacArthur more quarter here.  He has certainly preached the Gospel faithfully, and has had a terrific impact over the years.  My greater concern is with the lost, those Jesus came to save.  He was the master of reaching across cultures and breaking down religious division in order to share the simple Gospel of truth.  I’m thinking of the woman at the well, and I see people on the other side of these open handed issues as our opportunity to be like Jesus.  Yes, He spoke truth&#8230;..remember though&#8230;He first sat down, dined with, healed, defended, suffered aspersions&#8230;&#8230;I know you get it.</p>
<p>Thanks Courtney, I know these posts/opinions are hard for you to take.  I value your engagement.</p>

                    <p>Nice. So the faithful pastor, upholding the plain, historical and orthodox teaching of  Scripture, is now guilty of slander and evil thoughts when he uses that objective standard to call another professed Christian minister to account? Where did MacArthur slander anyone? He expressed his very real and actual concerns regarding Beth Moore&#8217;s ministry and her functioning as a pastor of both men and women. That isn&#8217;t slander. Nor is he guilty of evil suspicions when he&#8217;s simply pointing to what is already publicly known problematic and unapologetic behavior. It&#8217;s actually slanderous to impugn the conduct and character of another minister of Christ by misrepresenting what they&#8217;ve said and done, without actual (biblical) evidence of wrongdoing. Given most of what I&#8217;ve read here, maybe the sin we should be discussing is the bearing of false witness.</p>

                    <p>Mark, thank you for this article.  Well said!  I am deeply disturbed not only by the horrible remarks and responses made by John MacArthur and friends and folks at the conference, but by the many articles popping up, attempting to defend his indefensible attitude toward a fellow believer.  The attempt to justify his outrageous treatment of Beth Moore by shifting into high gear regarding women in ministry is heartbreaking to me. Those who defend him by disregarding his very unChristian behavior make matters worse for the church and undermine their position on scripture at the same time.  You hit the nail squarely on the head.  I am grateful for you and will hold you in my prayers.</p>

                    <p>Hey, if you guys don&#8217;t believe the Bible, that&#8217;s between you and God. I do believe the Bible, and it says that women should not be preaching and usurping authority and they ought to be busy taking care of their families. </p>
<p>I see no evidence in the world that the new way of doing things with women teaching and running things is working out well. I see moral decadence and social pathology and the decay of civilization. </p>
<p>I also think you feminists are making a mistake by arguing with the Christian Bible, because in the long run the alternative will be that the world will be forced to decide that Islam must  have been right about women all along. I think Christianity is right about women, not Islam, but when you destroy Christianity, what makes you think that your Marxist feminism will be viable?</p>

                    <p>Mark, you are, of course, completely wrong, and John MacArthur is right that no Biblical case can be made for a woman preacher. Beth Moore has rejected the Biblically distinct roles for men and women, husbands and wives. Listen here to Lori Alexander describing what the Bible actually does say: <a href="https://thetransformedwife.com/male-preachers-calling-out-female-preachers/" rel="nofollow">https://thetransformedwife.com/male-preachers-calling-out-female-preachers/</a>. MacArthur is even right in his harshness. Gross error needs to be rebuked. You and Beth Moore are pushing secular Progressivism, not Christianity.</p>

                    <p>Your entire comment is an ad hominem attack. Attacking the arguer instead of the argument. This is not about leftism. This article is addressing Macarthur&#8217;s demeaning and mean-spirited attitude toward Beth Moore. Her false teaching is irrelevant. Just because she may be a false teacher, doesn&#8217;t excuse John Macarthur&#8217;s unChrsitlike behavior. Yes, he&#8217;s allowed to disagree. But Jesus does NOT permit mocking or jeering.</p>

                    <p>Hello to all who have commented,<br />
     I really have enjoyed seeing everyone&#8217;s differing comments. All have made really good points.  Courtney you have helped me greatly in thinking better of JM&#8217;s side.  I still don&#8217;t agree with his word usage and tone.   I love John Macarthur. If I had seen this in him as a pattern of his behavior that would be one thing, but overall this is not his pattern.  As many of you may also like that applied to your daily Christian behavior and attitudes hey?  Does he have a bit of a tude?  Yep.  John Macarthur always has had that and I&#8217;ve heard him say how pride is something he has to be cautious of as anyone in his position would.  That&#8217;s not to make any excuse for sinning either. Spurgeon struggled with pride too.  Look at how God used him?  Luther as well&#8230;had terrible moods along with so many flaws&#8230;yet still God used this man greatly.   I have listened to JM for over 20 years. I have so many of his books.  He has done so much for the KINGDOM of God and likely more than most of us here on this page have done and likely he will withstand this outburst and continue to do great things for God&#8217;s Kingdom. But I do  believe this reaction is way over the top already.  Holy CoW!    I have heard him talk about woman over many sermons.  He does not have a low view of woman.  The fact that he&#8217;s flawed and a sinner?  Just like you and me?  Well&#8230;I&#8217;ve done this very same thing to people.  Who of us has not?  I&#8217;ve screwed up my words, my tone with so many people over the many years of serving Christ it&#8217;s truly sad.  But I run to the LORD and he quickly forgives me, just like we should run quickly to forgive each other.   And please believe me when I say this&#8230;it is agonizing to me the depth of my sinful state in NOT walking in forgiveness whenever a brother or sister sins against me.  I&#8217;m still called to love them EVEN IF they don&#8217;t REPENT!   1 Jn 1:8-9.  And something that you all have missed here is this&#8230;Ya know what?  God is Sovereign and guess what???  HE ALWAYS USES A BUNCH OF SCREWED UP PEOPLE AND STILL HE GET&#8217;S THE GLORY!  The Bible is filled with screwed up people telling of an AWESOME ALL POWERFUL GOD.  Is John Macarthur gonna slow God down?  Is John Macarthur  gonna screw up God&#8217;s  plan to save the lost&#8230;..????  Is John Macarthur really that all powerful??  Hahha&#8230;I think it&#8217;s kind of funny how dramatic we can be.  HOw does GOD let any of us breath in and out?  We can get all smug ourselves in pointing out each other&#8217;s sins and man&#8230;it will be all day long if I look at myself&#8230;and that&#8217;s only just what I know. I&#8217;m a lot worse than I think I am cowering under the MASSIVE HOLINESS OF AN AWESOME GOD!! It&#8217;s truly a bit comical, to me, of how quickly we all forget that??   I don&#8217;t say this in any cavalier manner either.  I mean it with fear and trembling before a HOLY, HOLY, HOLY God!!   Why may I ask are we so shocked that John Macarthur is not perfect?  Haha.  I think it&#8217;s a bit funny. What do you think Paul meant in&#8230;&#8221;I am the chief of all sinners.&#8221;  I mean really ?? Man he knew what he was.  He not only was saved, he was being saved.  And guess what?   John Macarthur, sorry to burst your bubble, is STILL being SAVED!!  He&#8217;s not there yet and neither are any of us.  Man we are just like a bunch coffee clutching old ladies&#8230;ready to ripe the a*s end out of poor mule donkey&#8230;heh heh. God must be shaking His head.    All this drama.  When we can really just look at someone like John and say, Yep&#8230;heh heh&#8230;I&#8217;m just like  you John and apply 1 John 1:8-9.  Crud! Then guess what?  I don&#8217;t flip out when my brother or sister in Christ&#8230;.what??? Sins? Or sin&#8217;s against me&#8230;even if they are not repentant.  Not my job to fix everyone.  Can&#8217;t do it.  I kind of think this is a good thing that happened actually.  Because, maybe, there are people listening to John and have him on some kind of pedestal and the next thing you know we are worshipping him instead of God.  Perhaps the LORD sovereignly  allowed us all to see John is a sinner too&#8230;and he needs Jesus  just like everyone else.   I&#8217;m glad we saw a bit of this in Dr. John Macarthur to tell you the truth.  Cuz when people come at me with, Well did you see what he said?  I&#8217;m gonna say yep and ya know what Jesus is not like that.  He&#8217;s not like any of us now is he? It&#8217;s all about HIM anyway isn&#8217;t it?  If they ask me I can say yep&#8230;John needs a Savior too.   Jesus will forever get the GLORY! Not me, not JM, not you.  JESUS will even when we screw up.  One of the things I love, love,  love about our precious Lord  Jesus is after he rises from the dead and he&#8217;s back with all the cowardly disciples  (like I would be) and instead of chastising them&#8230;what does he say?  &#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221; John 20:19.  He doesn&#8217;t say&#8230;&#8221;Why you stinking pack of cowards you&#8230;. and thanks so much, by the way,  for deserting me at my most terrible hour.&#8221;  I mean I totally would have done that.  I know me.   I mean is that so beautiful or what?  Did he know they would screw up? Did He know what they would do?   Let me think about that for just a second or two&#8230;um YEAH!!   Let us be quick to forgive our brother.  Quick to pray for him and his ministry.  I think Courtney makes a lot of really good points, but I also think Sean and Mark make some good points as well.  The thing I didn&#8217;t see said is&#8230;.We are just like JM.  We say wrong things&#8230;but our words are not open to everyone.  I bet if they were&#8230;ummmmm&#8230;.yeah.  Him without sin should definitely cast the first stone&#8230;as we all sadly walk away understanding what is needed for all is HIS AMAZING grace.  Man I need it every day.  I&#8217;m such a mess.  I&#8217;m not in any way excusing sin of anyone, but you are right Courtney we should not be slandering an amazing man of God all over social media and think that&#8217;s ok.  Now we are becoming the very thing we are angry about, which is usually the case I&#8217;ve noticed for myself when ever I start finger pointing. God humbles me and I&#8217;m back at square one.  I haven&#8217;t got a plank to stand on and I&#8217;m just as guilty as the next guy.  Let us all continue on and wallow in the amazing grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.  Let us be gracious to each other&#8230;as we all need to do this.   I know I do.  I really do need him every hour and every second of every day.  Let us wallow in the grace of our good King.  With much love because of HIS love.  Patty</p>

                    <p>With too many comments, this one may get lost, but..<br />
MacArthur et al are wrong from the start.  She is not a preacher/pastor and has no church to shepard.  Her message is NOT for men.  It is a relationship message of empathy and connecting with scripture for WOMEN.  These guys lack the ability to see outside their comfortable (and profitable) box and are clearly denigrating a threat to their reach and their pride.  Beth reaches an audience that they can&#8217;t and so they bluster and boast like the vipers they truly are.</p>

                    <p>The question is folks are we interpreting the Scriptures thru Christ crucified. Even if MacArthur disagree&#8217;s with Beth Moore, does he has to use saracasm and contempt to get his point across. In fact why did he have to mention her name? MacArthur loves the Bible more then he loves Jesus. In fact these comments prove this idolatry. He is an excellent Pharisee. The Pharisee&#8217;s knew their Bible too&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..and totally missed Jesus. As the British minister to the Vatican Lord Acton sagely observed in 1887&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.power tends to corrupt and total power absolutely. MacArthur has a lot of power and he has abused his power here. He has no humility. He believes in bullying , coercing and manipulating people with the Bible. JESUS NEVER DID THIS. I hope that Beth Moore and other women preachers listen and obey the Holy Spirit and not men.</p>

                    <p>Joni Erickson Tada was a speaker at John MacArthur&#8217;s Strange .   Why was her speaking to men ok, but Beth Moore&#8217;s speaking is not? I bet the response will be she was not speaking on Sunday, but that argument seems to be just semantics. The passage regarding elders need to be the husband of one woman was brought up in these comments, yet that same passage uses the same language for deacons.  However, many complementary churches allow woman deacons.  Not to mention we see women deacons even in scripture, I.e. Junia.  And rather than address the issue this article brought up, which was the total lack of love that John MacArthur and those with him on stage used when addressing Beth Moore, many of these comments have attacked the author.  John MacArthur&#8217;s comments were public therefore it is right to address him back publicly.  In fact, to not do so, would give the impression to the watching world that Chrisitians think it is right to treat women mean spiritedly and  dismissively.  The jewelry comment cannot in any context have a positive meaning.  It is a real job, but whether deserved or not, there is a very negative connotation associated with it.  It would be that same as calling someone a tax collector in Jesus day.  It feels like John MacArthur&#8217;s way of dealing with any issue is to destroy all allies.  Who knows if that is how he is or it just fits with the image of him being a 4th cousin to the great General Douglas MacArthur.  But is it God&#8217;s way?  I think every comment here that mentioned they will know us by our love is spot on.  God does not want us to be unloving toward other Christians.  However, I think this is where we do not really get the other sides argument.  They do not think it is bad to speak about Beth Moore as John MacArthur did because they do not view her as a Christian.  They see her as satanic so it does not matter how John MacArthur spoke to her.</p>

                    <p>Mark&#8230; what was your intent with your original remarks? Was your intent to further God’s Kingdom? We all ought to be very careful&#8230; remove the log. Do these comments posted on the internet foster unity? Do people who stumble across this blog like me see people who love one another? If you truly love might there have been a different approach to your concern about what John MacArthur said? Let’s be encouragers and spur each other on to good works!! His love and mine!</p>

                    <p>Hi Wendy! </p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to post such a helpful comment. I tried to be honest about my wrestling on this one. I really believe my motives are to defend a sister and call us away from a toxic and hateful way of interacting online. I tried to note that I don&#8217;t always trust my motives, and I continue to pray whether this is helpful or not. My conviction at this moment is that I&#8217;ve heard from a ton of people who are thankful that I defended Beth Moore and stood against slanderous speech in the name of God, whereas I&#8217;ve only heard from a few people that are offended at what I wrote, and most of those are just accusing me of not believing the Bible. So I still feel like the things I said needed to be said. I&#8217;m still praying and still open to being convinced that these words I&#8217;ve written should be taken down. I keep re-reading it and I still feel like it is furthering God&#8217;s kingdom (because the post is clarifying that God&#8217;s kingdom is not about bullying and dividing and demeaning). I also feel like it fosters unity because it&#8217;s calling us away from the kind of encampment attitude that parades disunity as doctrinal fidelity. </p>
<p>BUT I&#8217;m not perfect, and the log is always in my eye, and that is literally the reason we created a page called Jackass Theology, so we could confess our jackassery (I&#8217;m the foremost) and try to together walk away from it.</p>

                    <p>Hello Everyone!<br />
My name is Gabe, I am a 17 year old high school student trying to finish up my senior year as well as planning for the future. I am in the transitory stage where a HUGE number of  people decide that they do not want to be associated with the Christian faith. There are no doubt many varying reasons why they, &#8220;leave the faith&#8221; but many leave because they see little difference between the way Non-Christians act to each other and the way we, who are supposed to be filled with God&#8217;s love, act towards each other.  So I just wanted to say that, while this is a great site to see different opinions, If any of my non-Christian friends, or even many new converts, were to come upon one of the many articles like this one, I can pretty much state for a fact that their first thought would be, &#8220;I thought Christians were supposed to be loving?&#8221; To conclude, I just want to clarify that I am not perfect, (duh) and I can lose my temper as well but for those of you who see this, I hope you remember one thing. Are you showing God&#8217;s love with your comment?</p>

                    <p>I am amazed that someone that knows what The Masters Seminary and Dr John teach, can attack Dr John and defend Beth Moore.   For the record, the words posed by Todd Friel (&#8220;Beth Moore&#8221;) to Dr John (who said &#8220;Go home&#8221;) was in the context of the previous day&#8217;s presentation by Justin Peters at the Truth Matters Conference.   This pertains to ridiculous claims by Beth Moore such as:   God telling her to go outside to build Him a snowman;  And what about the bordering-on-crazy story by Beth Moore where she tells a female crowd that God instructed her to go brush a gentleman&#8217;s hair who was seated in some waiting area &#8211; without having a comb.  (2 Pet 2:1-3 shows how false teachers get rich from all their fake, made-up stories &#8211; especially what &#8220;God&#8221; apparently told them.)  This is what you are defending.  Beth Moore does not even understand basic verses like Heb 1:1-2.   Any person who defends the idea of female preachers / teachers IN CHURCH simply does not know Scripture. Their arguments are Scripturally baseless and pure emotion and pragmatism.  In the CONTEXT of Dr John&#8217;s words of &#8216;Go Home&#8217; &#8211; I would say that Dr John was actually being kind and gentle.  I personally would have stated it in a much stronger way.   Will I be attacked?  Yes.  So be it.  If you want to be biblical, you will be attacked.  But I understand Jesus&#8217; words in Luke 6:26.   And forget not God&#8217;s clear instruction in Tit 1:9 (refute those who contradict  sound doctrine) and Tit 1:11 (stop the mouths of deceivers) &#8211; and I view anyone who tells me &#8216;God told me&#8230;&#8217; as a deceiver.  I suggest if ANYONE really wants to hear the biblical position, please do listen to this sermon: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxtSRfNO5xo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxtSRfNO5xo</a></p>

                    <p>It has been announced that Beth Moore is going to be one of the speakers at Truett&#8217;s Seminary&#8217;s Preaching Conference 2020. Interesting that never once in her response to MacArthur did Beth Moore say she does not believe women should preach. I think that this along with her willingness to assume the pulpit with men present in the audience, and her holding the authority for teaching of the Word of God  over men is enough evidence that she is breaking ! Timothy 2. The American Feminization of Christianity has gone on because we as men have not taken our God-given responsibility to lead as Christ is the head of the church. If you don&#8217;t like MacArthir&#8217;s tone then perhaps you probably won&#8217;t like  then you are not seeing the seriousness of this issue. A harsh tone reveals a harsh truth. John the Baptist called the Pharisees and Scribes a &#8220;Brood of Vipers&#8221; &#8211; dang that was harsh, but only because the man was not playing around. Jesus called them &#8220;Whitewashed tombs&#8221; &#8211; and where was the love there? And Paul rebuked Peter openly in Acts &#8211; but come on now we cant take MacArthur calling Moore out? Just go back and read how the church fathers dealt with serious issues and maybe you wont be so scandalized.</p>

                    <p>Wow! The comments about Beth Moore bring narcissistic just do not ring true if you have listened to her teach. Thanks, Mark, for including the video clip. It was very enlightening to hear the tone of voice as well as the words. Certainly not spoken in love. Beth Moore directs her ministry to women in a way that no man does. Christian women greatly benefit from her and others like her. She is building up the church. Call it teaching or preaching &#8212; it is obvious to me that God&#8217;s hand is blessing her ministry to women. Shame on those who are trying to shame her!</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve had such a positive experience with Beth Moore, Lisa. Your experience matches what I&#8217;ve seen and heard from her over the years, and her gracious response to all of this only confirms my opinion of her as a godly, gracious, Spirit-filled woman who is doing everything she can to faithfully follow his call on her life and build up the church.</p>

                    <p>Faux outrage&#8230;..Virtue Signaling and moral preening.  The last Beth Moore &#8220;teaching&#8221;I heard , had her being &#8220;led by a spirit &#8221; to rummage around a stranger&#8217;s luggage and proceed to brush his hair. John Macarthur&#8217;s teaching is an oasis in the wasteland  that  the American church has become. Why, because he teaches God&#8217;s Word. Maybe all the publicity will help her achieve her desire to become the moderator of the Southern Baptist Convention. By the way, does anyone know where Mr Moore is?</p>

                    <p>MacArthur can believe with all his heart that women should not preach, but his dismissive, insulting tone and his un-Christian meanness turned me off to him completely.  I own his bible commentary, and I&#8217;ve occasionally listened to him on podcast or the radio &#8212; but no more.  I&#8217;m a prodigal who came back to the church in my mid-40s, and Beth&#8217;s bible studies were the first I had ever attended.  I thought her teaching was amazing, and I&#8217;ve done every study she has made and I&#8217;ve seen her personally speak 3 times.  She is a very good teacher, period.  I&#8217;ve learned so much about Jesus and God&#8217;s word because of her inspiring and sincere teaching.  I&#8217;m late to this story but when I heard it all I could think of was to pray for the heart, mind and soul of Beth Moore.  But take heart, Beth &#8212; you must be doing great work for the Kingdom of God for the devil to be so threatened that he would inspire this kind of attack against you &#8212; and particularly from an alleged brother-in-Christ.  I say Fight On!</p>

                    <p>Except MacArthur is warning against bad teaching. He wasn&#8217;t speaking to Beth Moore directly, nor was he preaching. He was asked about Beth Moore (and Beth Moore the ministry by implication) during a forum Q&amp;A. It&#8217;s entirely biblical and right  within that context to firmly warn against bad/dangerous teaching. Bottom line. And try as he might, Pastor Mark has yet to demonstrate from the Bible that MacArthur was wrong for doing what he did.</p>

                    <p>Hey Zach,</p>
<p>Maybe this would help, just as a thought experiment or a comparison. I would applaud Dr. MacArthur if he had said something like, &#8220;Beth Moore? She has been doing this or that specific thing, and I cannot state how strongly I disagree with her positions and actions. What she is doing is unbiblical, and I call her to look further into those passages and pray that God would allow her to see the truth. I cannot fully express how firmly I hold these convictions because I see them plainly taught in Scripture. I see no room for compromise here.&#8221; Notice that if he had said something like that, he would be standing firm on his interpretation of biblical truth, calling out sin, speaking against false teaching, everything you&#8217;ve been accusing me of not caring about or denying the importance of. I&#8217;d love to have seen Dr. MacArthur state it that way. </p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t. Instead, he told her to go home and said she should sell jewelry instead of using her gifts for ministry. Phil Johnson accused her of being narcissistic and preaching herself rather than Christ.</p>
<p>Can you see the difference between those two responses? There is a difference. So how would you categorize that difference? For me, one is standing firm on the truth, the other is demeaning a human being. One is holding firm to biblical convictions, the other is slander.</p>
<p>We could clear all of this up if you agree that my hypothetical response would have been better. If not, it seems to me you&#8217;re defending not just the THEOLOGICAL POSITION that Dr. MacArthur holds, but also the SLANDEROUS AND MEAN SPIRITED WAY IN WHICH HE SAID IT. If you praise Dr. MacArthur&#8217;s theological position, I&#8217;ll praise you as a brother. If you praise and seek to perpetuate demeaning human beings and slandering them, then I&#8217;d say, </p>
<p>&#8220;Woe to those who call evil good<br />
		and good evil,<br />
	 who put darkness for light<br />
		and light for darkness,<br />
	 who put bitter for sweet<br />
		and sweet for bitter!&#8221; (Is. 5:20)</p>

                    <p>Mark I would say you have a point here. The way we say things make a difference, and doing it in love is important.  Not calling out the Error of Beth Moore is evil.<br />
We don&#8217;t have the luxury of woman preachers, nor partnering with false teachers and saying they are ok because we think that is love. We don&#8217;t have the luxury of acting like the world.  Love is TRUTH. The Word of God is TRUTH. We are rooted in the Word and don&#8217;t have the luxury of thinking women can be preachers, nor Saying Joel Olstine and Joyce Meyer is ok as she does . As the body of Christ we don&#8217;t have that luxury!</p>

                    <p>Love is patient. Love is kind. Does not envy, does not boast. It is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered. It keeps not record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. </p>
<p>If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or clanging symbol. </p>
<p>Zach and Troy, your love for truth is admirable. These familiar verses show  the truth of what love is. It cannot be replaced by an alternate or partial definition.</p>

                    <p>Troy,</p>
<p>Thanks again for remaining a helpful discussion partner here. I genuinely believe your heart is in a great place, and I can see you offering me that same dignity. Another question:</p>
<p>On your reading of the relevant passages, you&#8217;re right that &#8220;we don&#8217;t have the luxury of woman preachers.&#8221; But do you hold open the possibility that your reading of those passages could be wrong? I&#8217;m not asking you to contradict Scripture, I&#8217;m asking if you think it&#8217;s possible that your understanding of Scripture could be driven by cultural assumptions in some places. I don&#8217;t hesitate to say that I know I misread Scripture. John MacArthur taught me that at a Shepherd&#8217;s Conference one time. He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m certain that I&#8217;m wrong about some things in Scripture. The problem is, I don&#8217;t know which things I&#8217;m wrong about!&#8221; I love that attitude. </p>
<p>So if it&#8217;s POSSIBLE that your reading of women preaching is off, then it&#8217;s POSSIBLE Beth Moore&#8217;s view is right. I&#8217;m not asking you to agree with her. I guess I&#8217;m just wondering if you think this is the hill to die on. Does a person&#8217;s commitment to Jesus and to Scripture stand or fall on whether or not they take the complementation view on women in ministry? If you&#8217;re tempted to answer yes, let me ask why Jesus didn&#8217;t talk about this. If it&#8217;s this vital of an issue, why are there only three, maybe four passages that deal with it, and why are those passages so hotly debated within virtually every branch of Christianity? I&#8217;m all for what you&#8217;re saying with regards to the importance of truth, but I think this is an interpretation issue and not a &#8220;do you believe the Bible or not&#8221; issue.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly curious what you think. Thanks for taking the time.</p>

                    <p>Hi Mark Thank you sir for your comment. No this issue isn&#8217;t worth dying on the hill for sure.1 timothy 12-14 says :I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.For Adam was formed first, then Eve;and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Paul is setting up the church model with these letters through the Holy Spirit. This is pretty hard to get the roles mixed up here. Very clear may I say? My old Pastor is of the idea this is purely of the times. We got along very good. For me one that is is partnering with false teachers. When my Pastor went  to the Saddleback conference this year with Rick Warren that was it for me. They had a catholic priest speak there. The Catholic Church isn&#8217;t a Christian church with the Gospel of Christ.  Galatians 1:9 is very clear about the different gospel.  The Word is very clear about false teachers and the hazards of them. To avoid them and also to call them out.  Beth Moore is being deceived by partnering with Joyce Meyer period. I can see from Beth and Joyce and even Christine Cane that they are being deceived by false teachers and are becoming ones as well.  No one is addressing this issue and its the bigger one.  Have you read Spurgeon the Sword and the Trowel?  He says &#8220;fellowship with known and vital error is participation in sin.&#8221;  Oh how easy it would be to Agree with Rick Warren , Oprah, and Beth Moore, along with the World. We are called to be set apart, different, even hated by the world. Standing firm in the Truth, the Word , the Gospel of Christ.</p>

                    <p>Again, Mark, you continue to (conveniently) ignore the context of their comments, as if they existed in  vacuum. And you know better. The real issue in all of this is the authority and sufficiency of Scripture. The biblical text is not ambiguous. In multiple places, as has been demonstrated to you may times, the Bible prohibits women from functioning in the role of pastor and teacher in the congregational context. You have not and cannot present a positive argument for women pastors from the scriptural text because one does not exist. Until you address this fundamental flaw in your argumentation, you&#8217;ll continue to undermine the very objective foundations on which a preacher of Gospel of Christ depends for his ultimate authority in the preaching of any and every other doctrine. If Biblical authority is to be questioned on this issue today then what about homosexuality tomorrow? Or the exclusivity of Christ for salvation the next day? The slippery slope of compromise is real and treacherous.</p>

                    <p>Zach, I find it disheartening that this discussion has devolved into attacks on people who hold a different point of view.  Mark is not ignoring the context of scripture.  Rather, he has provided multiple scriptural arguments for another point of view.  Mark is not arguing for the installation of women as pastors, he is advocating that Jesus followers follow his example of Grace.  Mark is not saying that Beth Moore’s stances on all issues are his stances, he is pointing out that she has been mistreated in the name of Jesus.  You will recall, Jesus was silent on the topic of women in leadership in the church.  He was not silent about the sin of usurping God’s authority to abuse others.</p>
<p>I think that if we read through this site and don’t see a mirror reflecting our own shortcomings as followers of Jesus, then we aren’t being honest with ourselves.  If we aren’t being honest with ourselves, then why bother wading into the dialogue?  As time has gone on, I’ve seen most of the comments on this topic stray from an open dialogue to defenses of positions already held.  Too bad.</p>

                    <p>Yes, Sean, he has. And you know what&#8217;s truly disappointing? When people falsely characterize the legitimate biblical criticisms of fellow believers as attacks. Paul exhorted his fellow brothers and sisters in Christ to be good Bereans. He lauded the Bereans because they desired a deep familiarity and knowledge of the Word of God, and because of their care in examining every doctrine in light of the entirety of Scripture. Those is positions of leadership, especially preaching and teaching, are under even greater responsibility. The Bible warns elders that they will be held accountable for how faithful and reverentially they represent God&#8217;s Word to the sheep He&#8217;s entrusted to their care. This isn&#8217;t a popularity contest. There&#8217;s much more at stake here.</p>
