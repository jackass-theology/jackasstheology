All right. Well, take care yourself. I guess that's what you're best, presence old master? A tremor in the Force. The last time felt it was in the presence of my old master. I have traced the Rebel spies to her.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.

I find your lack of faith disturbing. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Red Five standing by. Red Five standing by. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I find your lack of faith disturbing. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. As you wish.
<blockquote class="td-quote-classic">Thanks for looking at our theme</blockquote>
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? As you wish. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You mean it controls your actions?

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Ye-ha! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Red Five standing by. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I have traced the Rebel spies to her.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I call it luck.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Red Five standing by. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I find your lack of faith disturbing.
