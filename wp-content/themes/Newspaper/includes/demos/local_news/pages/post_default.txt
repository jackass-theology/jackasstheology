You're probably thinking that you know everything there is to know about the <a href="#">Rooftop Concert Series</a> You're saying to yourself, it started in 1986 and was on for 9 seasons and starred Andy Griffith.

Just because you can do something, should you? Samsung thinks so. Its second experimentally screened phone taps into its hardware <a href="#">R&amp;D and production</a> clout to offer something not many other companies.

The Rooftop Concert Series began in 2010 when four Provo residents (Sarah Wiley, <a href="#" target="_blank">C. Jane Kendrick</a>, Mindy Gledhill, and Justin Hackworth) met together to discuss ways they could get more people to come downtown.

Ccity has to offer one obvious starting point was the music that was being made played, and performed in Provo. How about concerts on the roof someone said and the Rooftop Concert Series was born.

And how does Apple's biggest phone compare to the Note Edge? Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider.

<h3><strong>FREE ENTRANCE</strong></h3>
Its curves are subjective and divisive; my friends and colleagues have offered up reactions ranging from outright bemusement to adoration. The screen looks great, with the punchy contrast and sharpness that's been a Samsung flagship mainstay for years. We'll get back to that edge, but it's the headline part of a 5.6-inch Quad-HD+ display.
<h3><strong>LIVE SOUND</strong></h3>
Make this secondary menu transparent, allowing me to maintain all that screen space. The ability to shrink the likes of Chrome and Google Maps to a popup window and layer it on top of other apps is also useful I'd love to see something similar on the iPhone 6 Plus continues to clear away.

If you're looking to learn more about the stylus uses, I'd advise a quick read of Brad's Galaxy Note 4 review, because the setup is identical here. Yes, there are TouchWiz bits running on Android 4.4 KitKat.

When it's expanded, the UI is a basic row of icons, which you can navigate with a little swipe. This may look a little unusual, but swishing through the various mini-screens is immensely satisfying.

The screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count. Like the Note 4, text pops a little more, and pictures you take with the 16MP camera are obviously better replicated on the Note Edge's screen.
