We have got to change our ethics and our personal financial system and our whole way of understanding the world. <span style="color: #cb9558;">It has to be a world in which people live rather than die a sustainable world. </span>

I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things. It's the attitude you bring to clothes that make the difference. Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul.

I still appreciate individuality. Style is much more interesting than fashion, really. <span style="color: #cb9558;"><strong><em>Attitude is everything. It's really easy to get colors right.</em> </strong></span>It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right.

Never in my wildest dreams did I entertain the idea that I would become a fashion designer. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.

I've treated the waistcoat as if it were a corset, so that it becomes the first layer in the process of putting clothes on the body. There is constant motion between layering and revealing.

I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.

You're only as good as your last collection, which is an enormous pressure. Elegance is not the thing of those who have just escaped from adolescence.You have a more interesting life if you wear cool cloths.

War taught me that not everything is glamorous. I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things.
