It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion. I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. <strong>Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only.</strong><blockquote>FASHION IS IN THE SKY, IN THE STREET, FASHION HAS TO DO WITH IDEAS, THE WAY WE LIVE, WHAT IS HAPPENING.</blockquote><em><strong>Vanity is the healthiest thing in life.</strong></em> My aim is to make the poor look rich and the rich look poor. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation,<em> but with the perfection of my style.</em>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row full_width="" parallax="" parallax_image=""][vc_column width="1/1"][td_block_title block_template_id="td_block_template_8" custom_title="Lateste Articles"][td_block_big_grid_5 td_grid_style="td-grid-style-5"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
