It has to be a world in which people live rather than die a sustainable world.I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things. It's the attitude you bring to clothes that make the difference. Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul.

I still appreciate individuality. Style is much more interesting than fashion, really. <strong><span style="color: #c44c4c;"><em>Attitude is everything. It's really easy to get colors right.</em> </span></strong>It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right.

I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.

You're only as good as your last collection, which is an enormous pressure. Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future.

Attitude is everything. You have a more interesting life if you wear impressive clothes. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. <span style="color: #c44c4c;">My dresses are very reasonably priced, for dresses that are cut on the body.</span>

War taught me that not everything is glamorous. I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things.

<div class="td-paragraph-padding-2">

<em><strong><span style="color: #c44c4c;">We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.</span></strong></em> Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity. Design and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort so you can get on with the things that matter.

I'm an accomplice to helping women get what they want. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.
