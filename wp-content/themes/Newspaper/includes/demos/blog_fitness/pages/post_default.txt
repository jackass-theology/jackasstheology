Khloe Kardashian has been hitting the gym hard and has not been letting herself slack, no matter what is going on in her life, as well as making sure that she sticks to a very strict diet. Khloe has since gone on to lose around 35lbs.
<blockquote>"Khloe gives as much to the gym as the gym gives to her"</blockquote>
Gunnar Peterson has praised Kardashian for her dedication. Her Beverly Hills-based trainer explains why Khloe's physical transformation has been so major: "We keep her mind challenged and her body guessing, and the focus is on building strength. She never cancels! Some days it's more heart-rate intensive, some days it's lower extremities intensive, some days the upper extremities get a little extra love."

He added: "As the changes have come, the diet has tightened up ... She's made better choices when she eats. She's been more conscious about working on sleep habits. She hydrates better. She keeps getting after it and she keeps getting better. We're always playing with our workouts. We're always making it that much more challenging." And that hard work and intense focus have helped our September cover star score what some might call a post-breakup revenge body.
<blockquote>"Yeah, it's a revenge body"</blockquote>
Khloe says. But it's just as much for all my critics who called me 'the fat one' for my entire existence." Her workout consists of a complete routine, two or three times a week, on nonconsecutive days. You can try it yourself! Starting with the first exercise, do the prescribed number of reps, then rest 10 to 30 seconds. Do two to five sets of each move, then continue to the next move and repeat until you've done the entire routine.

The latest and probably one of the most common sense ways to get fit and lose excess body fat is by making painless additions of exercise to your day, combined with small diet modifications. For example, current research has shown that by consuming just 100 fewer calories per day, a woman can avoid the 1-2 pound gain most of us take on each year.

If you want to lose weight, you need to increase your daily caloric deduction by 500 calories, but you can do this by cutting 200 calories out of your daily diet and burning 300 calories more through exercise.
<blockquote>Add that up over a week and you'll have nearly a pound of fat loss with very little pain or diet deprivation</blockquote>
It's the little things you do every day that can make the difference between keeping fit or packing on additional pounds every year. Don't underestimate the power of tiny changes: consistent, lifestyle changes are always more successful for losing and maintaining weight loss.

Be creative! Instead of thinking of all the ways you don't have time to exercise, make it a game to see how many ways you can carve out time for little bouts of exercise. Lose your all or nothing mindset and look at exercise as a daily accumulation of activity.

Remember, to lose weight you still need to take a look at your diet and try to eliminate excess calories, especially those that come from junk. Your goal isn't difficult cutting 200-300 calories from your daily diet can be easy if you choose foods that you won't miss too much.

Think about switching from a can a soda every afternoon to unsweetened iced tea or a flavored sparkling water. But remember, don't cut something that you look forward to every day (for me cutting cream in my coffee would be a deal breaker), instead look for little changes you can make that won't make a big difference in the foods your enjoy.
