Properties are defined within selectors by defining a property and a value. They are separated with a colon and delineated with a semi-colon.

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border (edge of the element.). We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content. Here, the div with id 'box' will get 10px of padding all around it. css class id selector code less sass sassy lang rule set propertie value element type attribute pseudo combinator statement identifier keyword comments example padding margin background color font size text decoration hover underline bold italic word wrap family syntax paragraph

The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other. Here, the div with id 'box' will get 10px of margin above and below it, and 5px of margin to the left and right. css class id selector code less sass sassy lang rule set propertie value element type attribute pseudo combinator statement identifier keyword comments example padding margin background color font size text decoration hover underline bold italic word wrap family syntax paragraph
