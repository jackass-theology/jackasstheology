A simple plugin for managing your WordPress website with Git.

== Description ==

Revisr allows you to manage your WordPress website with a Git repository. With Revisr, you can:

* Track changes to your entire WordPress installation, or just the parts that you prefer
* Commit changes from within the WordPress dashboard
* Backup or restore your entire website in seconds
* Set up daily or weekly automatic backups
* Optionally push or pull changes to a remote repository, like Bitbucket or Github
* Test changes out before deploying them to another server
* Revert your website files and/or database to an earlier version
* Quickly discard any unwanted changes

A must have plugin for deploying and managing WordPress using Git repositories.


== Installation ==

= Requirements =
* A web server with Git and WordPress installed
* The PHP exec() function enabled

= Instructions =
* Unzip the plugin folder and upload it to the plugins directory of your WordPress installation.
* If the WordPress installation is not already in a Git repository, you will be able to create a new one in the Revisr Dashboard.
* Go to the Revisr settings page and adjust any settings as needed.

= Notes =
Please verify that database backups are working before attempting to revert the database, especially if attempting to do so on a production website. Backups use the mysqldump command, supported by most hosts/environments.

If you're using the HTTPS method to connect to the remote repository, the password for the remote repository will be stored in the '.git/config' file. You should take steps to prevent this from being publicly accessible. The following code added to a '.htaccess' file in the '.git/' directory will prevent public access:

`
content: Deny from all
`

If you're using NGINX, you'll have to update your configuration file with something similar to the following:
`
location ~ path/to/your-repo/.git {
        deny  all;
}
`

This issue can be avoided entirely by using SSH to authenticate, which is recommended in most cases. If using SSH, you will need to generate a SSH key on the server and add it to the remote repository (Bitbucket and Github both support SSH).

It is also adviseable to add Revisr to the .gitignore file via the settings page to make sure that reverts don't rollback any new functionality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Revisr handle the database? =
You have complete control, and can decide whether you want to track the entire database, just certain tables, or if you don't want to track the database at all. Then, during a backup, the tracked database tables are exported via "mysqldump". When importing or restoring the database to an earlier commit, Revisr first takes a backup of the existing database, creating a restore point from immediately before the import that can be reverted to if needed.

You can also set a "Development URL" that will be automatically replaced in the database during import- allowing for backups and restores that work on both your dev and live environments.

= Why aren't my commits being pushed to Bitbucket/GitHub? =
This is either an authentication issue or the remote branch is ahead of yours.

= Can I damage my site with this plugin? =
Care should be taken when dealing with upgrades that depend on the database. Taking verified backups before and after major changes is always recommended.
