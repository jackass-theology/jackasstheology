The simplest and fastest WP Cache system

== Description ==

<h4>Official Website</h4>

You can find more information on our web site (<a href="http://www.wpfastestcache.com/">wpfastestcache.com</a>)

This plugin creates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.
When a page is rendered, php and mysql are used. Therefore, system needs RAM and CPU. 
If many visitors come to a site, system uses lots of RAM and CPU so page is rendered so slowly. 
In this case, you need a cache system not to render page again and again.
Cache system generates a static html file and saves. Other users reach to static html page.
<br><br>
Setup of this plugin is so easy. You don't need to modify the .htacces file. It will be modified automatically.

<h4>Multisite Support</h4>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know my blog is being cached? =
You need to refresh a page twice. If a page is cached, at the bottom of the page there is a text like "&lt;!-- WP Fastest Cache file was created in 0.330816984177 seconds, on 08-01-14 9:01:35 --&gt;".

= Does it work with Nginx? =
Yes, it works with Nginx properly.

= Does it work with IIS (Windows Server) ? =
Yes, it works with IIS properly.

= What does ".htaccess not found" warning mean? =

= How is "tmpWpfc" removed? =
When the cached files are deleted, they are moved to "tmpWpfc" instead of being deleted and a cron-job is set.

When all files in "tmpWpfc" are deleted, cron-job is unset.
